+ After skipping Zazen on Monday for the second time ever, I did go yesterday to a plum village gathering. But the goal wasn't as much to meditate, but rather to explore the future of the sangha
+ I did go today to the Zazen:
	+ My body was aching and felt restless.
		+ Frustration that the physical capacity is not expanding as much as is desired
	+ There was drowsiness during the session
		+ Mindless experience yet feeling of absorption
		+ Felt like a cloud was obscuring the view, but the car was moving none the less.
+ On the way back home, experienced a great feeling of anxiety
	+ It expanded exponentially when family called me for dinner
		+ I sat in my room for a few minutes.
			+ Breathe rising faster and faster, until a feeling similar to despair took over
			+ But a thought came: "Last time when there was anger, it was because of love"
				+ What might anxiety be a sign of?
			+ The only answer left was: "A lack of understanding"
+ Impressively, sitting a few minutes dramatically calmed mental agitation.
+ Questioning if a Sangha, or even the concept of community makes sense
	+ What is the end goal of it
	+ It does not last. It is fickle.
	+ There is clinging to it, despite its very impermanent nature
+ Do physical actual sanghas promote sangha as a refuge because it is a conflict of interest?
+ What if the third jewel didn't necessarily need to be in person?
