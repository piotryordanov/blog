      <description>The feeling that my unhappiness was coming from me not seeing girls or friends, is because, in reality, I was facing other problems, and in order to release the pressure and tension, I wanted to use the ways I have used so far to deal with stress: Sex, video games, and junk food. Video games are deleted, sex is non-existent, and junk food is heavily suppressed. However, meditation has been growing as an alternative for stress relief.</description>

      <description>Ramda is swiss toolbox of javascript functional programming. I have decided to use it in order to greatly simplify the way I am managing data processing.
As I was building Zeistab, I came across two challenges. The first was related to fetching data asynchronisally, while needing to wait for all to be fetched. I discussed it in detail in my post on using Ramda Map with async calls</description>

      <description>By far, the hardest Ramda challenge I faced while building Zeistab was running a R.map on a bunch of async functions, and then waiting for the result of all the async functions before proceeding. Normally, Promise.All does the job, but the question was to figure out how to integrate that with ramda.</description>
